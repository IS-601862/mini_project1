# Setting up Git and Collaboration with git

The third part of this assignment will differentiate the difference between forking and cloning, while providing examples. To elaborate, the assignment shifts to explaining a pull request and then to explain how to add a collaborator to a GitHub repository. 

* Forking vs cloning
* Pull request
* Adding a collaborator to a Github Repo.

## Forking vs Cloning

Cloning is done using Git, while Forking is done in the Github Account. Forking a repository is explained as creating a copy of the repository. An example of this would be when we submit an assignment document on Canvas to our professor - the document on our storage drive is not changed although the document is now shared with another user. When the other user makes changes, it will not affect the original document. On the other hand, cloning a repository, the repository remains in the initial machine using Git. An example of this would be best described as the way a shared Google Document works - where the content of a document can be changed by either user and both users will see the changes.

## Pull Request
This refers to the forked repository that is merged with the original repository. The purpose of this request is to merge the changes of the repository. 

## Adding a collaborator to a Github Repo.
Make note of the username of the collaborator then navigate to your Settings, which is under your repository project name. Under Collaborators, enter the username and select the it from the drop down menu, then click add collaborator.
